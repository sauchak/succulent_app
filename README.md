### Development Process

Inspiration for this came to me when my succulents bloomed and it destroyed my mind. So I decided on a narrative of an anthrompomorphic succulent plant confused about its existence and its purpose. This is for Succulents exists to help out those succulents who ask these questions.

### Unsolved Problems/Major Hurdles

- Access to a good plant api is difficult so there is no api currently.
- The behemoth that is jwts is overwhelming so there is no auth capabilities currently.
- Allow access to users.
- Create an actual database.
- Creating this site with angular was, perhaps, not the best use of angular, but I want to play around with ng-directives and services in the few days given for this project and this is what I settled on after running through several other ideas.
